Chainsight is a next-generation platform that enables you to bring any data onto the blockchain safely and easily. By utilizing advanced technologies such as Chain-Key cryptography and zkTLS, we ensure the authenticity and security of the data. Users can access data from any source on the web to build, manage, and monetize their own data solutions. Chainsight offers a comprehensive data solution that goes beyond being just an oracle provider.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Factory function, which enables users to freely register data from the user interface (UI), is currently only available in the Preview version. The official release of the Factory UI is scheduled for January 2025. At that time, data validation using zkTLS will also be introduced. For further details, please refer to the X announcement.

The Chainsight UI enables users to access data indexed in Chainsight via a customizable dashboard. Users can select specific charts to display their data and create a personalized dashboard with their preferred layout. This allows users to view and analyze exclusive data available only through Chainsight, including unique indexes and rating information.

Chainsight is a network consisting of a large number of indexers. Each individual indexer has its own data, which can be combined to efficiently build new data. This new data can be written directly to blockchains, such as Ethereum, eliminating the need for off-chain bridges. This allows on-chain applications to utilize the data they need.
