Chainsight is a next-generation data infrastructure that empowers anyone to bring external data onto blockchain networks securely and flexibly. By leveraging advanced technologies (such as **Chain-Key** cryptography and optional **zkTLS**), Chainsight ensures both the **integrity** and **reliability** of data feeds. Rather than being “just another oracle,” Chainsight provides a **full data pipeline** solution—from indexing data to deploying oracles—enabling sophisticated use cases far beyond typical price feeds.

We’ve set up a new environment **restricted to partners and early-access users**. If you’d like to try the new features before the public launch, please **contact us** on social or at contact@chainsight.network.&#x20;

The Chainsight UI enables users to access data indexed in Chainsight via a customizable dashboard. Users can select specific charts to display their data and create a personalized dashboard with their preferred layout. This allows users to view and analyze exclusive data available only through Chainsight, including unique indexes and rating information.

Chainsight is a network consisting of a large number of indexers. Each individual indexer has its own data, which can be combined to efficiently build new data. This new data can be written directly to blockchains, such as Ethereum, eliminating the need for off-chain bridges. This allows on-chain applications to utilize the data they need.
