# Introduction

Welcome to Chainsight â€” New Standard of Data Service Platform

### Chainsight Overview

Chainsight indexes or computes data from any source, stores it, and makes it propagatable across any network.
Chainsight provides a data platform that allows Web2/Web3 users to work with any cross-chain/real-world data.

### For Developers

With Chainsight, you can easily and securely prepare any necessary data, including economic indicators and price data for on-chain applications; deploy Data Indexer and Open Logic components in Chainsight, and make Optimistic Data Data Indexer and open logic components can be deployed in Chainsight to make the necessary data available to Optimistic Data Oracles. These Oracles can be deployed in various chains and data can be synchronized.

### For Data Analysts

Chainsight allows you to collect the data you need from any chain. (Only EVM is supported in the initial phase.) Analysts can acquire and analyze data as they wish by expressing the analyst's own logic, advanced analytical data such as volatilities and risk calculations can be seen in Chainsight. The collected data can be viewed in a dashboard and displayed as time-series graphs.
