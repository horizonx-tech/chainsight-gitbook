# FAQ

### Q. What is Chainsight?

Chainsight is a next-generation platform that allows you to bring any data on-chain safely and easily. By leveraging advanced technologies like [DKG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/339), [Chain-Key cryptography](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/360057605551-What-is-chain-key-cryptography) and zkTLS, we guarantee the authenticity and security of data. Users can obtain data from any data source on the web and build, manage, and monetize their own data solutions. Chainsight provides a comprehensive data solution that goes beyond just an oracle provider.

### Q. Who is Chainsight for?

Chainsight is designed for anyone who wants to utilize data on the blockchain. Specifically:

* **Developers and Project Teams**: Those who want to integrate reliable data and advanced analytics into their DApps.
* **Individual Users**: Those who wish to obtain, manage, and analyze data themselves and monetize their data.
* **Enterprises and Institutional Investors**: Organizations that require high-quality, verifiable data and want to build their own data solutions.

### **Q.** Why are we building Chainsight?

The current Web3 data environment faces many challenges, such as high costs, declining service quality, security risks, latency issues, and lack of transparency. Chainsight was built to solve these problems and to put the power of data back into the hands of users. By enabling users to obtain, manage, and monetize the data they need without relying on traditional oracle providers, we promote innovation and development across the entire blockchain ecosystem.

### Q. What types of data are available on Chainsight?

On Chainsight, you can access a wide variety of data, including:

* **Data from Any Web Source**: Data obtained from APIs and websites.
* **Time-Series Data Analysis Results**: Advanced analytics such as volatility, ratings, and trend indicators. e.g. [Stablecoin Rating](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kf_jQ4rbsh0NtY7zx8H4vPw_iY6fLY1S/view)
* **State from Other Blockchains**: Cross-chain data retrieval.
* **Custom Data Feeds**: Unique data feeds created and shared by users themselves.

### Q. Which networks does Chainsight support? Only EVMs?

Chainsight supports various blockchain networks, focusing primarily on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), and Aptos MoveVM compatible chains. We are continuously expanding the networks we support and are considering non-EVM chains by evaluating technical requirements and business value. For the latest information on network support, please check our official announcement.

### Q. What’s the new compared with other oracle providers?

Chainsight differs from traditional oracle providers in the following ways:

* **User-Driven Data Acquisition**: Users can obtain and manage the data they need without relying on specific oracles.
* **Advanced Data Analytics**: We provide on-chain time-series data analysis results such as volatility and ratings.
* **Security and Verifiability**: By leveraging advanced cryptographic technologies like Chain-Key cryptography and zkTLS, we ensure the authenticity and security of data.
* **Modular Data Tools**: Customize your data pipelines using Data LEGOs and modular tools.
* **Data Monetization**: Data providers can receive incentives, which will be implemented later.

### Q. Why is it safe to access? How to verify that?

Chainsight uses advanced cryptographic technologies like Chain-Key cryptography and zkTLS to ensure the safety and authenticity of data. This allows us to cryptographically prove that data has not been tampered with. Users can verify data on-chain and confirm its reliability and integrity.

### Q. We can’t find the data that I want. How can I create that?

With Chainsight's Factory function, you can independently obtain data from any source and deploy it on-chain. The Factory UI makes it easy to set up data acquisition and deployment. You also have the ability to share the data feeds you create with the community, enabling other users to utilize them and earn incentives in the future.&#x20;

### Q. Does Chainsight issue tokens?

No. Be careful with scams.
