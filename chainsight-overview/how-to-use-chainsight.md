# How to use Chainsight?

Chainsight can be utilized in several ways, depending on the user's objectives. For instance, some users may want to prepare data as an oracle and use it for their own on-chain apps, while others may wish to browse and analyze the indexed data. Additionally, you can create informative dashboards and share them with the community to showcase your insights. Explore the different ways you can benefit from Chainsight in the chart below.

2.  Factory UI

    If you want to add simple data to an indexer, synchronize that data to the EVM chain, and use the data from DApps, you can easily achieve this using the Factory UI. Note that the type and range of data that can be added are limited. Please wait as the scope of support is gradually being extended.

In addition to the above process, Chainsight can also be utilized to monetize data as a provider. For instance, you can use Chainsight to index information on sports and real estate, and then monetize that data. Please don't hesitate to contact us for further information.
