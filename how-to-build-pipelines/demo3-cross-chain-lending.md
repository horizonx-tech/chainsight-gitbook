# Demo3: Cross-Chain Lending

Cross-chain DeFi stands as one of the most promising use cases for Chainsight. This section illustrates a demo where Chainsight facilitates cross-chain lending.

Typically, managing lending or borrowing of assets across various chains poses a significant challenge. Protocols permitting the borrowing of one asset using another as collateral are termed as 'lending' protocols. However, these protocols are primarily designed to function within the same chain. This is due to the necessity of real-time settlement when the collateral reaches the liquidation threshold. Chainsight, with its ability to access cross-chain data, simplifies the lending and borrowing process across multiple chains. The diagram below illustrates the connection of lending protocols across different chains.
