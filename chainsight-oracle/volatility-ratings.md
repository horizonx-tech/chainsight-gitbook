# Volatility / Ratings

Chainsight offers advanced volatility and rating indicators based on historical asset price data and related information. These metrics provide valuable insights for DeFi protocols, enabling more sophisticated risk management and decision-making processes.

### Benefits of Using Volatility and Ratings Data

1.  **Dynamic Risk Management & Decision Making**

    Incorporate updating volatility data to dynamically adjust collateral requirements, liquidation thresholds, and asset listings in DeFi protocols. This ensures only high-quality, stable assets are included and managed effectively.
2. **Sophisticated Financial Modeling**\
   Implement more accurate pricing models for derivatives and options based on historical volatility. Create smart contract logic for automated portfolio rebalancing and advanced liquidation mechanisms that account for an asset's historical volatility, potentially reducing the frequency of liquidations during short-term price fluctuations.
3. **Cross-chain Insights and Optimizations**\
   Evaluate and compare risks across different blockchain networks using standardized volatility and rating metrics. This enables more effective cross-chain strategies, risk assessment, and potential arbitrage opportunity identification.
